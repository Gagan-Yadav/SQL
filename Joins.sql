-- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

-- Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

-- (INNER) JOIN :  Returns records that have matching values in both tables
-- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN :  Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
-- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN :  Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
-- FULL (OUTER) JOIN :  Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
