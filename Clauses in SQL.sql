-- A clause in SQL is a built-in function that helps to fetch the required records from a database table. A clause receives a 
-- conditional expression, i.e. a column name or some terms involving the columns. The clause calculates the result based on the 
-- given statements in the expression. When a large amount of data is stored in the database, clauses are helpful to filter and 
-- analyze the queries. There are different types of clauses in SQL that are available for fetching the desired data.

-- HAVING =>HAVING clause can be used in a GROUP BY clause. It is used to specify a search condition for a group in the database tables.
